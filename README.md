# pipam-apt

An apt-get plugin for [Pipam](https://github.com/pipam/pipam).

Provides package management from Pipam for apt-get. Only for Linux, specifically only for Debian/Debian-based (Ubuntu) distributions (apt-get is a Debian-only package manager). Also, this is a default platform plugin for Pipam, meaning that on the first startup of Pipam, if you're on a Debian system, this plugin will be installed.
